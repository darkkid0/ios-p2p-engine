CDNBye iOS P2P Engine scales live/vod video streaming by peer-to-peer network using bittorrent-like protocol. Powered by WebRTC Datachannel, this SDK can interconnect with the Web side [plug-in](https://github.com/cdnbye/hlsjs-p2p-engine) of CDNBye, which greatly increases the number of nodes in the P2P network, breaking the gap between the browser and mobile application. Merely a few lines of codes are required to quickly integrate into existing projects. As expected, it supports any iOS player!

## Features
- Interconnect with CDNBye [hlsjs-p2p-engine](https://github.com/cdnbye/hlsjs-p2p-engine)
- Support live and VOD streams over HLS protocol(m3u8)
- Support encrypted HLS stream
- Very easy to  integrate with an existing ios project
- Support any iOS player
- Efficient scheduling policies to enhance the performance of P2P streaming
- Highly configurable
- Use IP database to group up peers by ISP and regions
- API frozen, new releases will not break your code
